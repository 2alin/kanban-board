# Themes specs

This file contains specifications around the required theme values that the app requires.

## Theme types

Two type of themes are supported `dark-[id]` and `light-[id]`.

The theme values are defined in `themes.css` and we define the supported themes in `defaultSettings.ts`. 


## Themes CSS variables

Although not all the variables defined in `themes.css` are used, we should define shades for 50,100,200,...,800,900,950 so we can assure that all the shades used in the app are defined by the theme
